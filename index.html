              Isn’t it funny how these introductions are almost al&shy;ways
              written in the third person?

              My name is Katarina. This is my website. I’m a de&shy;signer with
              a strong narrative instinct, working across dig&shy;ital, print,
              and spatial forms. My skills span identity, brand strategy,
              edi&shy;torial, ty&shy;pography, web and digital, motion design
              and cre&shy;ative coding. I&nbsp;shift between disci&shy;plines,
              but at the heart of every&shy;thing I do is concept — curiosity,
              research, disrup&shy;tion and reassembly, responsive to
              con&shy;text, and stretched through experimentation.
              <br /><br />
              I was born and raised along the east coast of Aus&shy;tralia, with
              the last 12 years predom&shy;inately based in Melbourne. This year
              I moved to&nbsp;Copen&shy;hagen for an&nbsp;EU chapter, and
              honestly, still pinching myself.
              <br /><br />
              Before design, I worked across adjacent creative fields, from the
              development and perfor&shy;mance of contem&shy;porary plays,
              to&nbsp;original de&shy;vised pieces realised and trans&shy;lated
              through the&nbsp;Su&shy;zuki Method<span

                <i>Glyphs as Artefacts</i> is an experimental typeface
                that&nbsp;embraces a trans&shy;disci&shy;plinary approach,
                in&shy;ter&shy;twining in-depth personal reflection with the
                physical act of design. Memories infuse each glyph with
                mean&shy;ing, forming the basis of a type&shy;face that serves
                as both a visual record and an embodi&shy;ment of lived
                experi&shy;ence. <br /><br />
                The process began with a method I used in perfor&shy;mance — a
                way of work&shy;ing from an au&shy;thentic, moment-to-moment
                place. It centred on active verbs: to hijack, to relish, to warn
                — used to un&shy;lock mem&shy;ory and emo&shy;tional entry
                points into the text. I translat&shy;ed that same ap&shy;proach
                into type design — each letter triggered a&nbsp;word, each word
                a&nbsp;memory. I&nbsp;followed the thread, gave it&nbsp;voice.
                Recorded. Transcribed. Exter&shy;nalised. I&nbsp;then took
                the&nbsp;memory to paper, letting form follow feeling.
                <br /><br />
                Once the glyphs felt resolved, I digitised and refined. The
                final outcome: an experimental up&shy;percase type&shy;face and
                an audiovisual piece — a&nbsp;loop&shy;ing, 26-minute sequence
                cycling through each letter, never static, always in flux,
                accom&shy;panied by sound design — panning, droning, dissonant —
                drawing you through a&nbsp;space of rup&shy;ture and recall,
                where mem&shy;ory falters and re&shy;connects.

                In my final year, I was one of four students se&shy;lected to
                develop the visual identity for <i>des&shy;ignX 24</i> —
                an&nbsp;annual exhi&shy;bition cele&shy;brating graduates from
                all twelve path&shy;ways of the uni&shy;versity’s Bach&shy;elor
                of&nbsp;Design. <br /><br />
                With our team managing every aspect of the exhi&shy;bition’s
                digital and physical presence — from social media assets and
                printed collateral to large-scale exhibition graphics — our goal
                was to&nbsp;trans&shy;late this celebration into an
                ener&shy;getic and seductive visual experience that resonated
                across all touch&shy;points.
                <br /><br />
                While the work was highly collaborative, I took the lead on
                creative coding — developing cus&shy;tom code-based visuals that
                defined the iden&shy;tity’s vis&shy;ual syn&shy;tax. I&nbsp;was
                also responsible for designing and deliv&shy;ering all
                mo&shy;tion and dig&shy;ital assets.
